// They are two subcommands because the useful half needs no build. The
// checks below are REFERENTIAL — they ask whether the manifest's names
// are the names something stages — and the staged names are static, so
// they can run on every commit against the committed manifest. Only the
// packing waits for a release, where the binaries exist.
//
// A schema would not catch any of this. Every failure here produces a
// manifest that is well formed, packs, installs, and then does nothing:
// an entry point nobody staged, an override for a platform the bundle
// does not claim, a platform whose command is another platform's binary,
// a ${user_config.x} that was never declared, a launcher choosing
// between names the packer does not write. Those are facts about the
// archive rather than about the document.

// version so a manifest in the tree cannot claim a stale one.
